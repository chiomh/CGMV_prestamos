## Obtaining the MCVL data 

This paper uses anonymized administrative data from the Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales (MCVL) with the permission of Spain's Dirección General de Ordenación de la Seguridad Social. 
We are not permitted to give this data to others. 
Interested researchers can request access to the data to the Spain's Dirección General de Ordenación de la Seguridad Social.
For the required steps to obtain the data and to build the raw panel data, we refer the reader to two excellent sources:

- De la Roca and Puga's replication website that can be found here https://diegopuga.org/data/mcvl/, with instructions on how to apply for the data. 
- Detailed files on building a panel and cleaning the data by Cristina Lafuente https://github.com/crisla/MCVL.
